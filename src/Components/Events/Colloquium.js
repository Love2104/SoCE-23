                    2023):
                    <br />
                    About LCA: LCA is a tool used to evaluate a product's or
                    process's environmental impacts over its entire life cycle,
                    from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal. It
                    enables us to make informed sustainable decisions about
                    products and processes thereby also giving opportunities for
                    improvements to identify and cut back waste and pollution.
                    Sustainability has become an increasingly important
                    consideration in all engineering fields and LCA is a crucial
                    tool in achieving sustainable development. Big corporations
                    in domains like, but not limited to sustainable financing,
                    trading, FMCG & Manufacturing are conducting LCA on their
                    products and processes to identify the scope of improvements
                    to meet their set SDG goals. The workshop aims to introduce
                    OpenLCA software used to conduct such assessments.
