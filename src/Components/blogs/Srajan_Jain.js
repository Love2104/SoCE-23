            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>
              Hello everyone, I am Srajan Jain, a final year UG student in civil
              engineering, currently placed in Morgan Stanley for the Sales and
              Trading Associate role. Through this blog, I want to share my
              college journey by focusing on the placement side of it. In the
              initial semesters, I was determined to explore everything we do
              here at IITK. So, I worked in fests, Aero club, Ecell, practiced
              with the swimming team, participated in galaxy/takneek, etc. One
              of those things was competitive coding. I liked it and kept doing
              it as a hobby for some time. Then came the pandemic, and every
              activity on the campus stopped temporarily. At that time, I
              started focusing on academics and understanding courses, unlike
              first-year.

            <h3>Summer Project:</h3>
            <p>
              In the summers, I wanted to do an internship but needed more
              skills to find one. So I decided to explore different fields. I
              started with web dev and learned it for a while but found it
              boring. Then, I studied ML and DL and also did a related project.
              Along with these, I was also doing competitive programming. I
              found DL interesting, but CP was something where I was
              progressing, so I switched my focus there and started giving more
              and more contests. Then came the fourth semester, and I again
              switched to academics mode. I also did a project this sem because
              I wanted to make sure my internship resume was accurate.
              Everything went smoothly, but COVID-19 infected me at the end
              semester, so my performance declined. Then came the essential
              summers. Unlike some others, my goal was clear. I wanted to get an
              internship next semester. I continued competitive coding in the
              summers and also started Interviewbit. Also, I did a deep learning
              project for the resume.

            <h3>Internship semester:</h3>
            <p>
              So, this was a vital semester for which I was preparing. At this
              point, I had a decent CPI, some good projects, and my coding
              skills were decent (codeforces expert). The Internship tests
              started, and I performed well in some of them. Even after solving
              all the problems in some tests, I was not shortlisted for an
              interview, probably due to the civil department. Only after the
              midterms, this struggle continued, I got a couple of interviews,
              but they were different from the profile I was aiming for. I gave
              those interviews only because the stipend was reasonable. I didn't
              get selected for those companies. In the mid sem exams, my
              performance could have been better. At this point, I started
              focusing more on academics and applied to relevant companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the fifth semester, I didn't get an internship; I
              did manage a dassa. I was determined not to intern in a profile I
              wasn't interested in or where the stipend was less. My backup plan
              was to take an off-campus internship in an SDE startup if I didn't
              get what I wanted on campus. The phase-2 of the internship season
              started, and the opportunities this time were significantly less.
              One good thing was that most of the students from circuital
              branches were gone, so getting shortlisted was easier. I gave some
              tests and got shortlisted for WorldQuant. It was a good company,
              the profile was excellent, and the stipend was decent. I prepared
              for the interview by doing the 50 challenging problems book. An HR
              round followed by two technical rounds. In the first technical
              round, they asked puzzles related to probability and some coding
              questions. It went perfectly! I was able to answer all the
              questions. In the second round, I got stuck with some questions
              with correlation, but it went decently. The HR round was canceled
              for some reason, and ultimately I got selected.

            <h3>Summers before placements:</h3>
            <p>
              The PPO offer at WorldQuant was too good. I wanted it, like all
              others. But I knew they would offer it to only 2-3 interns in
              India. So, it was challenging. I had two options- either giving my
              100% to the internship and trying for the PPO or preparing for
              placements with the training. Given the package at WQ, I chose the
              first option. In the first month, I worked well. The work at WQ
              could have been better structured, and nobody was concerned there
              if you were doing anything at all or not. I used to complete my
              work on time, but an extra effort needed to be included; maybe
              that was why I didn't receive a PPO.

            <h3>Placement semester:</h3>
            <p>
              At this time, I had a decent CPI, and my internship project also
              improved my resume. I had better coding skills then, completing
              all standard problems from Leetcode. The resume-making process was
              tiring as we had to have tens of iterations before the final
              resume. You can contact me anytime if you are reading this and
              need help with a resume review.
            </p>
            <p>
              The placement tests started, and I applied for all the
              SDE/Quant/Finance companies. Those days went by so fast. We used
              to contact our friends from other colleges, asking them about the
              questions the companies asked. Then we practiced those questions
              and finally gave the tests. That is a time when you require
              complete determination. The tests were going well for me, and my
              name started coming in interview shortlists. Everything was going
              well when three weeks before the end semester, I fractured my
              right hand in an accident, leaving me unable to write. I had to go
              home for the surgery, taking leave for 15 days. I had to miss most
              of the placement tests for that duration. I also missed the
              quizzes for all the courses at that time. I was on the verge of a
              sem drop, but I opted for surgery without plaster and was somehow
              miraculously able to write three weeks after the surgery. I wrote
              the exams, passed all the courses, and was back on track for
              placements. Fun fact - I gave my test for Morgan Stanley only with
              my left hand, as it was just a few days after the surgery. Now I
              proudly say ki "Placement lagwana toh mere baayen haath ka khel
              hai "xD

            <h3>Day 1.1</h3>
            <p>
              Now came the day for which I had been preparing for so long. I had
              three shortlists (WorldQuant, MS, and CapitalOne), and my first
              interview was at WorldQuant at midnight. I was about to get ready
              when at 11 AM, I got a call from a CoCo that CapitalOne wants to
              take an on-paper test before the interviews. The test was easy;
              they asked the standard LRU cache question. After the test, I
              returned in a hurry for the WorldQuant interview. The interviewer
              asked me about a trading-related problem in the first interview
              round. He didn't expect any previous knowledge from me. He just
              wanted to know my thought process. I answered using machine
              learning, and he was satisfied with it. He also asked a few
              questions about my resume and internship experience. Overall it
              was easy. It felt like they wanted to avoid taking those who had
              already interned at WQ, so they were asking easy questions. After
              that, I started receiving calls to give Morgan Stanley's first
              round. But I went for WorldQuant's second round before that. The
              interviewer asked me probability puzzles and math and coding
              questions in the second round. I was able to answer all his
              questions.It was around 2 AM when I first reached the floor where
              Morgan Stanley's interviews were taking place. The process
              consisted of two technical rounds (roughly 45 min each) and an HR
              round (20 min). In my first round, the interviewer asked about
              some basic probability puzzles and then discussed my Deep Learning
              project in detail. After that, he asked me about my internship
              project in detail.

              He also asked me about my role as Mess Secretary at Hall 1 and the
              hardships I faced. After some grinding, the interview ended. It
              went well. I got the call for the second round 15 minutes after
              the first round. This round started with some off-topic discussion
              about the notice boards in Hall-12. Then he asked me about my role
              as an organizer in Udghosh and what exactly I did. After that, we
              discussed one of my projects where I used the Vector
              Autoregressive model. Then he came to my internship project and
              started intensive grinding. He asked for all details about it,
              including what was done and what could have been done. This
              continued for 30 min. In the end, I was unsure if he was
              convinced. Finally, I received the call for the HR interview after
              15 minutes. She asked some standard HR questions and some new
              ones. I answered all of them confidently. I did not receive any
              call from WorldQuant, so I was sure I wasn't proceeding further in
              their process. It was around 4:30 AM, and I was told that
              CapitalOne had already finished its interviews with a hotlist
              among the shortlist. So I waited for almost an hour, hoping that
              WorldQuant might call me, and then returned to my room as I had
              other interviews on Day 1.2. The next day I realized that I wasn't
              added to the NK Securities interview group even when shortlisted.
              I called them to confirm when I found out that my account was
              frozen and I had already got selected in MS.

            <h3>Some tips and resources:</h3>
            <p>
              Be with your friends; they are the most robust support system.
              Also, maintain your mental health in the last few months. It will
              exhaust you but try to do some physical activity and keep your
              mental peace. Remember to take a rest between interviews. And
              finally, help your friends after you get placed.
